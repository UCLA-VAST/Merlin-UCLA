# This file is only for testing DSE Python code with Python 3
# The reason to have a separate requirement package file is that
# sqlite used in OpenTuner does not support Python 3 and should be
# upgraded to sqlite3. As a result, this file should be removed
# after we achieve fully Python 3 compaitble.
