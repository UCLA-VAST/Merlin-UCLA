// Tainted flow analysis.
//
// The original version of this tainted flow analysis was written 2012-09 by someone other than the author of the
// genericDataflow framework.  It is based on the sign analysis (sgnAnalysis.[Ch]) in this same directory since documentation
// for the genericDataflow framework is fairly sparse: 5 pages in the tutorial, not counting the code listings) and no doxygen
// documentation.
//
// This file contains two types of comments:
//    1. Comments that try to document some of the things I've discovered through playing with the genericDataflow framework.
//    2. Comments and suggestions about usability, consistency, applicability to binary analysis, etc.
//
// [RPM 2012-09]
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


// USABILITY: Names of header files aren't consistent across the genericDataflow files. E.g., in the "lattice" directory we
// have "lattice.h" that defines the Lattice class, but "ConstrGraph.h" that defines "ConstrGraph" (and apparently no
// documentation as to what "Constr" means).
#include "lattice.h"
#include "dataflow.h"
#include "liveDeadVarAnalysis.h"        // misspelled? Shouldn't it be liveDeadVarsAnalysis or LiveDeadVarsAnalysis?


// USABILITY: The abundant use of dynamic_cast makes it seem like something's wrong with the whole dataflow design.  And I
//            couldn't find any documentation about when it's okay to cast from Lattice to one of its subclasses, so I've made
//            the assumption throughout that when the dynamic_cast returns null, the node in question points to a variable or
//            expression that the live/dead analysis has determined to be dead.
//
// USABILITY: No doxygen comments throughout genericDataflow framework?!?  But it looks like there's some doxygen-like stuff
//            describing a few function parameters, so is it using some other documenting system?  I at least added the headers
//            to the docs/Rose/rose.cfg file so doxygen picks up the structure.
//
// USABILITY: The genericDataflow framework always produces files named "index.html", "summary.html", and "detail.html" and
//            a directory named "dbg_imgs" regardless of any debug settings.  These are apprently the result of the Dbg::init()
//            call made from the main program, and this call is required (omitting it results in segmentation faults).  The
//            file names are constant and therefore one should expect tests to clobber each other's outputs when run in
//            parallel.  The contents of the files cannot be trusted.  Furthermore, since these are HTML files, an aborted test
//            will generate only a partial HTML file which some browsers will choke on.
