 *
 *  A SnippetFile represents a source file that contains one or more related snippet functions along with other necessary
 *  information at the global scope.  Each Snippet is associated with exactly one SnippetFile and whenever any snippet from the
 *  file is inserted into a specimen, certain statements from the snippet file's global scope are copied into the specimen's
 *  global scope. This copying happens only once per SnippetFile-specimen pair. By placing related snippets in the same source
 *  file we can be sure that only one copy of the snippet's global prerequisites are injected into the specimen. By keeping
 *  unrelated snippets in separate files we can prevent global prerequisites for one snippet to be inserted when an unrelated
 *  snippet is injected.
 *
 *  The SnippetFile class keeps a list of all its objects and returns a pointer to an existing SnippetFile in preference to
 *  creating a new one.  The lookup is performed according to the source file name supplied to the instance() constructor (no
 *  attempt is made to determine when unequal names resolve to the same source file). */

/** Simple mechanism for inserting statements into a specimen.
 *
 *  This class implements a simple API for inserting crafted statements into locations in a (typically) larger specimen. It
 *  isn't intended to handle all possible cases, but rather to be an alternative to the more complicated SageBuilder
 *  interface. See "Limitations" below.
 *
 * @section S1 What is a snippet?
 *
 *  A snippet is a function in a snippet source file (SnippetFile) along with prerequisites in its global scope. The statements
 *  of the snippet are injected into a specimen function at a chosen insertion point akin to inlining, and the snippet's global
 *  prerequisites are injected ino the specimen's global scope. For C source code, each function definition in the snippet file
 *  is a snippet.
 *
 *  A Snippet object is usually created with the instanceFromFile() class method, which takes a snippet name and a file name
 *  and returns a reference-counted pointer to the snippet. This method efficiently handles the case when multiple related
 *  snippets are defined in a single file (a practice that allows related snippets to share their global prerequisites).
 *
 * @code
 *  SnippetPtr foo = Snippet::instanceFromFile("foo", "snippetfile.c");
 *  SnippetPtr bar = Snippet::instanceFromFile("bar", "snippetfile.c");
 *  SnippetPtr banana = Snippet::instanceFromFile("banana", "fruit.c");
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section S2 The injection process
 *
 *  A snippet is injected along with its global prerequisites via its insert() method.  The first argument is a SgStatement
 *  cursor to indicate where the insertion is to take place (the snippet is inserted before the cursor). The remaining
 *  arguments are either variable declarations (SgInitializedName) or expressions (SgExpression) that are bound to the formal
 *  arguments of the snippet and thereby expanded into the specimen during the injection. They should be variables or
 *  expressions that are valid at the point where the snippet is injected.
 *
 * @code
 *  SgStatement *cursor = ...;                    // statement before which snippet is inserted
 *  SgInitializedName *var_a = ..., *var_b = ...; // insertion point variables to be bound to snippet
 *  SgExpression *expr_1 = ...;                   // insertion point expression to be bound to snippet
 *
 *  foo->insert(cursor);                          // insert snippet foo() with no arguments
 *  bar->insert(cursor, var_a);                   // 1st arg of snippet bar() is bound to var_a
 *  bannana->insert(cursor, var_a, expr_1, var_b);// 3 args of bannana() are bound to things
 * @endcode
 *
 *  Two modes of insertion are supported: The INJECT_BODY mode copies the snippet's body scope into the insertion point so that
 *  all snippet local variables remain in the same (new) scope as the rest of the inserted snippet statements.  This is quick
 *  and easy, but doesn't allow two snippets that are inserted at the same level in a function to share any local variables
 *  (but they can still both refer to variables at the injection site via argument binding in the insert() method).  The
 *  alternative is INJECT_STMTS, which doesn't create a new scope for the injected statements, but rather copies each statement
 *  individually to the injection site.  During INJECT_STMTS mode, snippet local declarations are copied to either the
 *  beginning of the injection point's function, or to the end of that function's list of declarations (see
 *  setLocalDeclarationPosition()).
 *
 * @section S3 Parameterized data types
 *
 *  Sometimes a snippet needs to know the type of an actual argument, and this is accomplished with a function-local typedef
 *  that has a special name.  If the snippet has a formal argument named "a" then a typedef for "typeof_a" will be modified so
 *  its base type is the same type as the actual value bound to "a". This only works when the type of the actaul value is
 *  consistent with the default value provided in the typedef.  For instance, here's the implementation of a snippet that swaps
 *  the value of two variables regardless of the type of the variables (this works as long as 'int' can be replaced with the
 *  actual type and still be syntactically correct):
 *
 * @code
 *  // This snippet operates only on integers
 *  void swap_ints(int a, int b) {
 *      int tmp = a;
 *      a = b;
 *      b = tmp;
 *  }
 *
 *  // This snippet operates on any type. The type "int" here is
 *  // only a place holder so the snippet can be parsed.
 *  void swap(int a, int b) {
 *      typedef int typeof_a;
 *      typeof_a tmp = a;
 *      a = b;
 *      b = tmp;
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section S4 Global declarations
 *
 *  Snippets often require additional support in the form of global variables, data types, and function declarations. Whenever
 *  a snippet is inserted into a target, other declarations and definitions at the same level as the snippet (global scope for
 *  C, or class scope for Java) are also copied into the target AST.  This also includes all "import" statements for Java.
 *  However, function definitions (and their enclosing declaration) are not copied unless the copyAllSnippetDefinitions
 *  property of the associated SnippetFile is set.  Copying these things occurs at most once per (snippet-file, target-file)
 *  pair so that multiple definitions are not inserted when more than one snippet is inserted into a single target.
 *
 *  A declaration in the snippet file can be black-listed for copying by calling SnippetFile::doNotInsert.
 *
 * @section S5 Recursive insertion
 *
 *  Snippet insertion is optionally recursive (see setInsertRecursively()).  If one snippet's expansion results in calls to
 *  other snippets defined in the same snippet file, then the other snippets are injected at the point of their call. Only
 *  direct calls (not function pointers) at the statement level (not in subexpressions) are recognized. Here's an example:
 *
 * @code
 *  // Snippet file
 *  void assert(int);
 *  void *malloc(unsigned);
 *  void *memcpy(void*, const void*, unsigned);
 *  unsigned strlen(const char *);
 *
 *  void notNull(const void *x) {
 *      assert(x != (const void*)0);
 *  }
 *
 *  void copyTo(void *dst, const void *src, unsigned nbytes) {
 *      notNull(dst);                           // may be expanded recursively
 *      notNull(src);                           // may be expanded recursively
 *      memcpy(dst, src, nbytes);
 *  }
 *          
 *  void storeStringInHeap(const char *s) {
 *      unsigned s_size = strlen(s) + 1;
 *      char *storage = malloc(s_size);
 *      checkAllocation(storage);               // may be expanded recursively
 *      copyTo(storage, s, s_size);             // may be expanded recursively
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section S5 Variable renaming
 *
 *  In order to avoid conflicts between the names of local variables in the snippet code and variables that are visible at the
 *  point of insertion, any snippet local variable whose name begins with "tmp" will be renamed to "T_xxxxxx" where "xxxxxx" is
 *  a randomly generated string of letters.  For example, when inserting allocate_string which also inserts copy_string10 from
 *  the snippet below, the two tmp_size variables are given two different names, but the heap_storage variable is not
 *  renamed--presumably because the user is interested in that specific variable.
 *
 * @code
 *  void copy_string10(char *dst, const char *src) {
 *      unsigned tmp_size = strlen(src);
 *      tmp_size = tmp_size > 10 ? 10 : tmp_size;
 *      memcpy(dst, src, tmp_size);
 *      dst[tmp_size] = '\0';
 *  }
 * 
 *  void allocate_string(const char *s) {
 *      unsigned tmp_size = strlen(s) + 1;
 *      char *heap_storage = malloc(tmp_size);
 *      copy_string10(heap_storage, s);
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section S6 Limitations
 *
 *  Any header-file declarations referenced by any code copied from a snippet file's AST to the target AST (snippets themselves
 *  or those copied things described in the "Global declarations" section above) must also already be present in the target
 *  AST.  Practically speaking, this means any #include directives in snippet files must also exist in the target file.
