/** Base class for all IR node attribute values.
 *
 *  This is the base class for all attribute values stored in the Sage IR node using the @ref AstAttributeMechanism. IR node
 *  attributes are polymorphic based on this abstract class, and are always allocated on the heap. Once the attribute value is
 *  handed to an attribute container method the container owns the value and is reponsible for deleting it.  In the case of
 *  methods that only optionally insert a value, the value is deleted immediately if it's not inserted.  But see @ref
 *  getOwnershipPolicy for additional information.
 *
 *  The underlying @ref Sawyer::Attribute mechanism can store values of any type, including POD, 3rd party types, and
 *  pointers. On the other hand, the @ref AstAttributeMechanism interface described here stores only pointers to values
 *  allocated on the stack, owns those values, and supports operations that are useful specifically in IR nodes.
 *
 *  Subclasses should each implement a virtual @ref copy constructor, which should allocate a new copy of the value.  The
 *  implementation in this base class returns a null pointer, which means that the attribute is not copied into a new AST node
 *  when its AST node is copied.  If a subclass fails to implement the virtual copy constructor and a superclass has an
 *  implementation that return non-null, then copying the AST node will copy only the superclass part of the attribute and the
 *  new attribute will have the dynamic type of the superclass--probably not what you want!
 *
 *
 *
 *  For a more detailed description of using attributes in ROSE (and your own classes) see @ref attributes. */

    /** Who owns this attribute.
     *
     *  The original implementation of this class from the early 2000's did not have clear rules about who owned a
     *  heap-allocated attribute.  The documentation was silent on the issue, and the implementation seemed to imply that
     *  container ownership was intended but was then commented out at some point.  Any ownership policy should have the
     *  following properties:
     *
     *  @li Attributes allocated on the heap should not be leaked. For instance, if an AST is deleted, then the attributes that
     *      were referenced by the AST nodes should also be eventually deleted.
     *  @li The mechanism should not place undue burden on the user.  For instance, if a user copies and later deletes an AST
     *      to which some analysis has attached attributes, the user should not need to be concerned with deleting attributes
     *      stored in the copy.
     *  @li The mechanism should be able to support either deep or shallow attribute copies as appropriate for the
     *      attribute. The deep vs. shallow copying policy is implemented by the virtual @ref copy method, which must
     *      coordinate with the ownership policy to ensure no leaks.
     *
     *  We define four ownership policies, although from the standpoint of an attribute container there are really only two:
     *  the container either deletes attributes or doesn't delete attributes.  The four ownership policies are:
     *
     *  @li @c CONTAINER_OWHERSHIP: The simple approach to ownership, and the one that we recommend for all new attribute
     *      subclasses, is that the attribute container owns the attributes.  When the container is copied (e.g., as part of
     *      copying an AST node) then it invokes the @ref copy methods of its attributes, and when the container is deleted
     *      (e.g., as part of deleting an AST node) then it explicitly deletes its attributes. This policy is an "allocate and
     *      forget" approach: once the creator inserts an attribute into the container it transfers/moves ownership to the
     *      container and the creator never needs to invoke @c delete.  This policy also means that users never need to
     *      explicitly delete attributes if they copy and then delete an AST.  Newly designed attribute subclasses should use
     *      this policy unless they have a very good reason to use another policy.
     *
     *  @li @c NO_OWNERSHIP: Another simple approach is that ownership is transfered to the operating system.  In other words,
     *     the attribute is <em>never</em> deleted by the program and its memory is reclaimed only when the program terminates.
     *     Attribute containers that are incorporated into objects that are frequently allocated and/or copied and then deleted
     *     will result in a large number of leaked attributes.  This approach is not recommended and is present only for
     *     laziness.
     *
     *  @li @c CUSTOM_OWNERSHIP: A third approach is that the attribute subclass implements its own ownership policy, which
     *     ideally should have the properties listed above. An attribute using this policy will never be deleted by an
     *     attribute container; the class must implement some other mechanism for tracking which attributes are allocated and
     *     whether they can be safely deleted.
     *
     *  @li @c UNKNOWN_OWNERSHIP: This final policy is for subclasses implemented before clear attribute ownership rules were
     *     defined.  Due to the ambiguity in the original AstAttributeMechanism implementation and the fact that attributes
     *     are used by code outside the ROSE library, this must be the default implementation.
     *
     *  Regardless of the ownership policy, an attribute must not be deleted while it is a member of an AstAttributeMechanism
     *  container. This is because in order for the container to decide whether it should delete the attribute, it must first
     *  ask the attribute for its ownership policy.  In other words, the following code will likely result in a segmentation
     *  fault:
     *
     *  @code
     *   SgDirectedGraphEdge *edge = ...;
     *   delete edge->getAttribute("info");
     *   delete edge; // INVALID ACCESS TO EDGE ATTRIBUTE HERE

/** Stores named attributes in Sage IR nodes.

 *  This attribute container stores one non-null, heap-allocated attribute per user-specified name.  All values are derived
 *  from @ref AstAttribute.  Any object can have an attribute container data member. For example, each AST node (@ref SgNode)
 *  contains one attribute container named @ref SgNode::get_attributeMechanism.
 *
 *  The value class's @ref AstAttribute::getOwnershipPolicy "getOwnershipPolicy" method indicates whether the container owns
 *  the heap-allocated attribute and therefore whether the container is responsible for invoking @c delete on the attribute
 *  when the container is destroyed.  New attribute subclasses should use the @ref AstAttribute::CONTAINER_OWNERSHIP policy if
 *  possible.
 *
 *  IR node attribute values are always on the heap. Whenever an attribute container is copied, the container invokes the @ref
 *  AstAttribute::copy "copy" method on all its attributes. The attributes' @c copy should either allocate a new copy of the
 *  attribute or return a null pointer. Since these values must be derived from @ref AstAttribute, it is not possible to
 *  directly store values whose type the user cannot modify to inherit from @ref AstAttribute. This includes POD types and
 *  classes defined in 3rd party libraries (e.g., @c std::vector). To store such values, the user must wrap them in another
 *  class that does inherit from @ref AstAttribute and which implements the necessary virtual functions.
 *
 *  The names of attributes are strings and the container does not check whether the string supplied to various container
 *  methods is spelled correctly.  Using a misspelled attribute name is the same as using a different value name--in effect,
 *  operating on a completely different, unintended attribute.
 *
 *  The @ref AstAttributeMechanism is used by AST nodes (@ref SgNode) and is available via @ref SgNode::get_attributeMechanism,
 *  although that is not the preferred API.  Instead, @ref SgNode provides an additional methods that contain "attribute" as
 *  part of their name. These "attribute" methods are mostly just wrappers around @ref SgNode::get_attributeMechanism.
 *
 *  Users can also use @ref AstAttributeMechanism as a data member in their own classes. However, @ref Sawyer::Attribute is
 *  another choice: not only does it serve as the implementation for @ref AstAttributeMechanism, but it also supports checked
 *  attribute names and attributes that are values rather than pointers, including POD, 3rd-party types, and shared-ownership
 *  pointers. The amount of boilerplate that needs to be written in order to store a @ref Sawyer::Attribute is much less than
 *  that required to store an attribute with @ref AstAttributeMechanism.
