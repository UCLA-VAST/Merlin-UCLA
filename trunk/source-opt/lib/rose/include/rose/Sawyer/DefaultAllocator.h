/** Allocator proxy.
 *
 *  Allocators are copied by value when containers are created, which means that each container would normally have its own
 *  allocator.  However, sometimes, like for pool allocators, performance can be better if multiple containers could share an
 *  allocator.  An allocator proxy allows containers to share allocators by having the proxy reference the allocator.  When the
 *  proxy is copied, the new copy continues to point to the original allocator.
 *
 *  Example usage:
 *
 * @code
 *  Sawyer::PoolAllocator pool; // one pool of memory for all graphs
 *  typedef Sawyer::ProxyAllocator<Sawyer::PoolAllocator> PoolProxy;
 *  typedef Sawyer::Container::Graph<int, int, PoolProxy> Graph;
 *
 *  Graph g1(pool);
 *  Graph g2(pool);
