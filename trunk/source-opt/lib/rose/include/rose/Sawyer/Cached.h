/** Implements cache data members.  A cache data member either stores a value or stores no value. When its value is
 *  present, it can be obtained, and when absent it has no value (not even a default constructed value).  The value of a
 *  cache data member can be modified even when its object is const.  For instance, an object that caches an
 *  expensive-to-compute value could be declared thusly:
 *
 * @code
 *  struct Foo {
 *      Cached<Bar> bar_;
 *  };
 * @endcode
 *
 *  When a Foo object is constructed the @c bar_ member will contain nothing (not even a default-constructed
 *  object). Here's a sample implementation that returns the value, performing the expensive calculation and caching the
 *  result if necessary.  The method is declared to take a const @c this pointer since it is conceptually a data member
 *  accessor:
 *
 * @code
 *  const Bar& Foo::bar() const { //typical accessor declaration
 *      if (!bar_.isCached())
 *          bar_ = expensiveComputation();
 *      return bar_.get();
 *  }
 * @endcode */
