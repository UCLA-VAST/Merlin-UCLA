 *  solutions.
 *
 *  Each time a solution is found, the @p SolutionProcessor is invoked. Users will typically provide their own solution
 *  processor since the default processor, @ref CsiShowSolution, only prints the solutions to standard output. The solution
 *  processor is only called for complete solutions when the end of a search path is reached; it is not called for intermediate
 *  solutions.  The processor can return a code that indicates how the algorithm should proceed. See @ref CsiShowSolution for
 *  more information.
 *
 *  To use this class, instantiate an instance and specify the two graphs to be compared (they can both be the same graph if
 *  desired), the solution handler callback, and the vertex equivalence predicate. Then, if necessary, make adjustements to the
 *  callback and/or predicate. Finally, invoke the @ref run method. The graphs must not be modified between the time this
 *  solver is created and the @ref run method returns.
 *
 *  The following functions are convenient wrappers around this class: @ref findCommonIsomorphicSubgraphs, @ref

/** Find immediate pre- or post-dominators.
 *
 *  Given a graph, find the immediate pre- or post-dominator of each vertex, if any, and return them as a vector. The vector,
 *  indexed by vertex ID, contains either a pointer (vertex iterator) to the dominator vertex, or no pointer (end vertex
 *  iterator) if the vertex has no dominator.
 *
 *  The algorithm employed here is loosely based on an algorithm from Rice University known to be O(n^2) where n is the number
 *  of vertices in the control flow subgraph connected to the start vertex.  According to the Rice paper, their algorithm
 *  outperforms Lengauer-Tarjan on typicall control flow graphs even though asymptotically, Lengauer-Tarjan is better.  The
 *  Rice algorithm is also much simpler.
 *
 *  I've added a few minor optimizations:
 *  @li Reverse post-order depth-first search is calculated once rather than each time through the loop.  Rice's analysis
 *      indicates that they also made this optimization, although their listed algorithm does not show it.
 *  @li The first processed predecessor of the vertex under consideration is determined in the same loop that processes
 *      the other predecessors, while in the listed algorithm this was a separate operation.
 *  @li Self loops in the control flow graph are not processed, since they don't contribute to the dominance relation.
 *  @li Undefined state for <code>idom(x)</code> is represented by <code>idom(x)==x</code>.
 *  @li Nodes are labeled in reverse order from Rice, but traversed in the same order.  This simplifies the code a bit
 *      because the vertices are traversed according to the "flowlist" vector, and the index into the "flowlist" vector
 *      can serve as the node label.
 *  @li Back edges in the flowlist are ignored since their dominator must be along a forward edge.
 *
 *  The set of dominators of vertex @em v, namely <em>dom(v)</em>, is represented as a linked list stored as an array indexed
 *  by vertex number. That is
 *
 * @code
 *  dom(v) = { v, idom(v), idom(idom(v)), ..., start }
 * @endcode
 *
 *  is stored in the @c idom array as:
 *
 * @code
 *  dom(v) = { v, idom[v], idom[idom[v]], ..., start }
 * @endcode
 *
 * This representation, combined with the fact that: <em>a ELEMENT_OF dom(v) implies dom(a) SUBSET_OF dom(v)</em>
 *
 * allows us to perform intersection by simply walking the two sorted lists until we find an element in common, and including
 * that element an all subsequent elements in the intersection result.  The @c idom array uses the flow-list vertex numbering
 * produced by a post-order visitor of a depth-first search, and the nodes are processed from highest to lowest. */
