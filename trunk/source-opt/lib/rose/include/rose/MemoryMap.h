/** An efficient mapping from an address space to stored data.
 *
 *  This class maps addresses in a 64-bit virtual address space to bytes stored in buffers and is a specialization of @ref
 *  Sawyer::Container::AddressMap.  A MemoryMap stores pairs of address ranges and segments, and each segment points to a
 *  buffer. The address space is segmented into non-overlapping, contiguous regions called "segments" (@ref
 *  Sawyer::Container::AddressSegment) and the addresses in a segment are mapped 1:1 onto data storage containers (@ref
 *  Sawyer::Container::Buffer).
 *
 *  Buffers come in a variety of kinds, all derived from @ref Sawyer::Container::Buffer and they are reference counted via
 *  shared-ownership smart pointers (@ref heap_object_shared_ownership).  Always refer to a buffer with its @c Ptr type. They
 *  should be created with various @c instance class methods, and they should never be explicitly freed.
 *
 *  MemoryMap objects are reference counted and always created on the heap. They are referred to by the @ref Ptr type which can
 *  be usually treated as an ordinary C++ pointer.  Objects can be created with the static method @ref instance, or by doing a
 *  shallow copy of an existing object using the @ref shallowCopy method. Plain assignment (operator=) is similar to @ref
 *  shallowCopy in that after the assignment the two objects will have independent copies of the segment information but will
 *  share the underlying data buffers.  MemoryMap objects should not be explicitly deleted since the shared pointers will
 *  delete the object when it's no longer referenced.
 *
 *  Here's an example of mapping a file into an address space at virtual address 0x08040000 and then temporarily replacing the
 *  second 1kB page of the file with our own data.  We demonstrate using a @ref Sawyer::Container::MappedBuffer because these
 *  are very fast for large files, especially if only small parts of the file are accessed due to their use of OS-level memory
 *  mapping.
 *
 * @code
 *  using namespace Sawyer::Container;
 *
 *  // Create and initialize the overlay data
 *  myData_size = 8192;
 *  uint8_t *myData = new uint8_t[myDataSize];
 *  initialize(myData, myDataSize);
 *
 *  // Create the two buffers: one for the file, one for the overlay data
 *  Buffer::Ptr fileBuf = MappedBuffer::instance("the_file", boost::iostreams::mapped_file::readonly);
 *  Buffer::Ptr dataBuf = StaticBuffer::instance(myData, myDataSize);
 *
 *  // Create the memory map.
 *  MemoryMap::Ptr map = MemoryMap::instance();
 *  map->insert(AddressInterval::baseSize(0x08040000, fileBuf->size()),
 *              AddressSegment(fileBuf, 0, MemoryMap::MM_PROT_READ, "the file contents"));
 *  map->insert(AddressInterval::baseSize(0x08040000+1024, dataBuf->size()),
 *             AddressSegment(dataBuf, 0, MemoryMap::MM_PROT_RW, "data overlay"));
 * @endcode
 *
 *  A MemoryMap provides methods to easily read from and write to the underlying data storage, addressing it in terms of the
 *  virtual address space.  These functions return the addresses that were accessed, and are prefixed by calls that describe
 *  what data is to be accessed.
 *
 * @code
 *  // read part of the data, right across the file/overlay boundary
 *  uint8_t data[4096];
 *  size_t nRead = map->at(0x08040100).limit(sizeof data).read(data).size();
 *  assert(nread==sizeof data);
 * @endcode
 *
 *  The Sawyer documentation contains many more examples.

     *
     * @section syntax Locator Syntax
     *
     *  The locator string is a file name preceded by various other parameters to control where the file is loaded in memory.
     *  It takes the form:
     *
     * @verbatim
     *  :[ADDR][+VMSIZE][=PERM]:[OFFSET[+FSIZE]]:FILENAME
     * @endverbatim
     *
     *  The fields between the first and second colon are parameters for virtual memory; the fields between the second and
     *  third colon are parameters for the file.  Their meanings are:
     *
     * @li @c ADDR: The virtual address where the first byte of the file is mapped.  This can be specified in decimal,
     *     octal, or hexadecimal using the usual C syntax.  If no address is specified then the file is mapped at the lowest
     *     unmapped region which is large enough to hold the file.
     *
     * @li @c VMSIZE: Size of virtual memory to map.  If VMSIZE is not specified then it is either the FSIZE (if specified) or
     *     the file size.  On POSIX systems the file size is that which is reported by @p stat, and on other systems it is
     *     the number of bytes that can be read from the file. The size can be specified as decimal, octal, or hexadecimal with
     *     the usual C syntax.  If VMSIZE is greater than the specified or calculated FSIZE then the data from the file is
     *     padded with zero bytes.
     *
     * @li @c PERM: Accessibility for the mapped segment.  If present, it should be any of the letters "r", "w", and/or "x" in
     *     that order to indicate readable, writable, and/or executable.  If not present, the accessibility of the segment is
     *     the same as the user's accessibility of the file (on POSIX systems; "rwx" on Windows systems).
     *
     * @li @c OFFSET: Byte offset within file for first byte to map. If no offset is specified then zero is assumed. The size
     *     can be decimal, octal, or hexadecimal in the usual C sytax.
     *
     * @li @c FSIZE: Number of file bytes to map.  If not specified the entire readable content of the file is mapped beginning
     *     at the specified OFFSET but not exceeding a specified VMSIZE.  If this number of bytes cannot be read from the file
     *     then an error is thrown.
     *
     * @li @c FILENAME: Name of file to read. The file must be readable by the user and its contents are copied into the memory
     *     map.  Once inside the memory map, the segment can be given any accessibility according to PERM.  The name of the
     *     segment will be the non-directory part of the FILENAME (e.g., on POSIX systems, the part after the final slash).
     *
     * @section exampes Examples
     *
     *  To load a couple raw files at the lowest available addresses:
     *
     * @code
     *  :::myfile1.bin :::myfile2.bin
     * @endcode
     *
     *  To load a 4k page of zeros with read and execute permission at address 0x7ffff000 (won't work on Microsoft systems):
     *
     * @code
     *  :0x7ffff000+0x1000=rx::/dev/zero
     * @code
     *
     *  On Microsoft Windows one could create a large file containing zeros:
     *
     * @code
     *  :0x7ffff000+0x1000=rx::myzeros.dat
     * @endcode
     *
     *  To load the .text and .data segments from a PE file when we know where they occur in the PE file but the PE file is
     *  damaged to the point where it cannot be loaded by ROSE's @c frontend. Both sections are zero-padded since the
     *  memory segment size is larger than the file size.  But if one wants to more closely emulate the Windows loader, leave
     *  off the file sizes:
     *
     * @code
     *  :0x01000400+0xa00=rx:0x1000+0x9a8:proxycfg.exe
     *  :0x01000e00+0x200=rw:0x3000+8:proxycfg.exe
