    //   ARM naming is a total mess! The term "ARM" is used for the company that licenses all this, and the architecture, and
    //   some of the instruction sets, and some of the implementations. For instance, "ARM10E" is an implementation of
    //   "ARMv5TE" architecture having the "A32" (a.k.a., "AArch32") and "T32" (a.k.a., "Thumb", which also sometimes means
    //   both "Thumb" and "Thumb-2") instruction sets, all of which was designed by "Arm Holdings". Another case in point: the
    //   "Thumb-2" instruction set was extended and named "ThumbEE" (why not just "Thumb-3"?), was erroneously called
    //   "Thumb-2EE" in some ARM documentation, and was marketed as "Jazelle RCT".  Then there's the inconsistencies with
    //   dashes and spaces, as in "ARM Cortex-A64" and "ARM Neoverse E1" which are both implementations created by Arm
    //   Holdings; and inconsistencies in capitalization as in "ARM" vs. "Arm" (as in "Arm Limited") vs. "arm" (as on the title
    //   page of Arm Limited's instruction reference guide); "Armv8" vs. "ARMv8", etc. It's no wonder that references like the
    //   Wikipedia page for ARM (if "ARM" is even the correct term) are riddled with mistakes, and disassemblers like Capstone
    //   are confusingly ambiguous, and ROSE itself has poor documentation for all things ARM related. The whole thing is a
    //   rat's nest probably creatied by some overzealous marketing department.
    //
    //   Since ROSE is using Capstone for the decoding, instead of spending more effort trying to make heads and tails of this
    //   mess, I'm going to just use the same parameters as Capstone, namely a set of non-orthogonal and ill-documented
    //   enums. Best of luck to you.
