/** Analysis to determine how to make one AST look like another.
 *
 *  Actually editing one tree have the same shape as another is, in many cases, nonsensical but the edit distance metric is
 *  nonetheless useful to determine the similarity of two trees.  See @ref Analysis::compute for details about how this
 *  analysis is implemented.
 *
 *  The way the analysis is used is like this:
 *
 * @code
 *  using namespace Rose::EditDistance;
 *  SgNode *ast1 = ...;                  // The first subtree
 *  SgNode *ast2 = ...;                  // Second subtree
 *  TreeEditDistance::Analysis ted;      // Object for performing the analysis
 *  ted.substitutionCost(0.0);           // Adjust some parameters
 *  ted.compute(ast1, ast2);             // Run the analysis
 *  double cost = ted.cost();            // Query some results
 * @endcode
 *
 *  Or in one expression:
 *
 * @endcode
 *  double cost = TreeEditDistance::Analysis()
 *                    .substitutionCost(0.0)
 *                    .compute(ast1, ast2)
 *                    .cost();
 * @endcode
 *
 *  The analysis object can be reused as many times as one likes by calling its @c compute method with different trees. The
 *  query methods always return the same results until the next call to @c compute. */
