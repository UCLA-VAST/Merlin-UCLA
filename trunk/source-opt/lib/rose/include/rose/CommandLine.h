/** Command line parsing.
 *
 *  This namespace encapsulates those things necessary for parsing the command-line for a ROSE-based tool. Command-lines
 *  consist of switches and their arguments, and positional arguments. The command-line parsers in this class are mainly for
 *  parsing the switches and their arguments, while the remaining non-switch, positional arguments can be retreived for parsing
 *  in a per-tool specific manner.
 *
 *  Command-line switches consist of an introductory sequence of characters (usually a hyphen or two) followed by the switch
 *  name. If the switch takes an argument (or arguments), that argument can be specified either as a separate entry in the
 *  program argument list (usually "argv") or separated from the switch name with an equal sign. On Unix systems, switches can
 *  also be single letters, can nestle together, and can take arguments either in the same @p argv entry or in the following
 *  entry.
 *
 *  Related switches are collected into switch groups which also have names. The name of the group is usually precedes the
 *  switch name and is separated from it by a colon.  Group names are optional on the command-line if the switch name is
 *  unambiguous.
 *
 *  All of these behaviors can be adjusted using the underlying @ref Sawyer::CommandLine API.
 *
 *  Parsers come in two flavors. The first flavor, "normal parsers", are suitable for programs that are able to define all
 *  their legal switches. They parse command-line switches and until they get to the first positional argument, or they can be
 *  configured to collect and skip over the positional arguments if desired.
 *
 *  The second flavor of parser, a "parser stage", is for programs that are unable or unwilling to define all their
 *  switches. In this mode, if a program argument has a prefix (e.g., "-") that looks like a switch but hasn't been defined as
 *  one, then it's considered to be an unrecognized switch and that single program argument is consumed and stored in an
 *  unrecognized switches list. Note that this is not a rigorous way to parse command-lines since the parser has no knowledge
 *  of how many arguments a switch takes.  For instance, if "-log" is a valid, defined switch that takes one argument, and
 *  "-yaxis" is undefined but takes as an argument a sign ("+" or "-") followed by the word "linear" or "log", then the command
 *  "a.out -yaxis -log foo bar" will be parsed as having an undefined switch "-yaxis" followed by the switch "-log" whose
 *  argument is "foo", followed by one positional argument "bar". The correct parsing, had yaxis been defined, would have been
 *  switch "-yaxis" whose argument is "-log" followed by two positional arguments "foo" and "bar".
 *
 *  This API is part of the ROSE library and can call any functions in the ROSE library. See also, CommandlineProcessing, which
 *  has only lower-level functions that cannot call other parts of the ROSE library. */

/** Generic command-line components.
 *
 *  Returns a description of the switches that should be available for all ROSE tools. For consistency's sake, most tools will
 *  want to have at least this set of switches which is intended to be common across all tools. These switches fall into some
 *  categories:
 *
 *  @li Actions: switches that cause some special action to be performed such as showing the documentation or version number,
 *      or running self-tests. If such a switch is specified, its action is performed instead of the tools normal action.
 *
 *  @li Adjustments: switches that cause a tool-wide adjustment in behavior, such as how internal program logic errors are
 *      handled or what diagnostic facilities are enabled.
 *
 *  @li Defaults: switches that provide default values for multiple software components, such as the maximum number of threads
 *      that a parallel analysis can use, or the name of the default SMT solver connection. These defaults are generic in the
 *      sense that they don't prescribe requirements for all components--they only provide defaults for those components that
 *      don't otherwise have a command-line setting.
 *
 *  To make a command-line parser that recognizes these switches, add the switches to the parser using its @c with method.  For
 *  example, here's how to construct a parser that recognizes only these switches:
 *
 * @code
 *  static Sawyer::CommandLine::ParserResult
 *  parseCommandLine(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 *      Sawyer::CommandLine::Parser parser = Rose::CommandLine::createEmptyParser(purpose, description);
 *      return parser
 *          .with(Rose::CommandLine::genericSwitches()) // these generic switches
 *          .with(mySwitches)                               // my own switches, etc.
 *          .parse(argc, argv)                              // parse without side effects
 *          .apply();                                       // apply parser results
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 *  In general, we want all tools to have all these switches. At a minimum, a tool developer should be aware that the switches
 *  in this group are in some sense reserved across all tools and should not be circumvented for other purposes. However, if a
 *  tool doesn't use a switch, the developer can remove that switch from the parser and its documentation in order to prevent
 *  user confusion. Here's an example of removing the "--threads" switch from a parser for a tool that doesn't support multiple
 *  threads:
 *
 * @code
 *  Sawyer::CommandLine::Parser p = createParser(purpose, description).with(genericSwitches());
 *  p.removeMatchingSwitch("--threads=1"); // must parse
 * @endcode
 *
 *  If you encounter strange errors near this call, make sure you're using -pthread consistently in your compile and link
 *  commands. Its presence or absence should be the same as however the ROSE library itself was compiled and linked. Mixing up
 *  the -pthread switch creates ABI incompatibilities that manifest themselves in various ways that usually look like a problem
 *  with a function that's called from a program that uses librose: often a segmentation fault, but can also be hangs,
 *  incorrect results, etc.  Note that -pthread is both a compile and a link switch.
 *
 *  See any recent tool for more examples.
 *
