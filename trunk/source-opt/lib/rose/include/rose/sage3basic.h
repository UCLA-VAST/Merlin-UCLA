/*
 * This header (or its precompiled version) includes the forward declarations of all the Sage IR node classes ("Sg*")
 * from the ROSETTA-generated files (i.e., gives just the class names).
 *
 * Every source file (.C) that becomes part of librose should include "sage3basic.h" as the first included file before any C++
 * token is processed by the compiler, thus allowing a precompiled version of this header to be used.  This applies to pretty
 * much every .C file under the $ROSE/src directory.  Such source files should not include "rose.h".
 *
 * No librose header file (those under $ROSE/src) should include sage3basic.h, rose_config.h, or rose.h.  If a header file
 * needs something that's declared in sage3basic.h then include sage3basic.h in the .C file first (GCC cannot use the
 * precompiled version if it is included from inside another header).  If a header file needs a configuration macro (like
 * HAVE_WHATEVER) from rose_config.h, then it should include "rosePublicConfig.h" instead (and use ROSE_HAVE_WHATEVER).
